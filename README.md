# randomize
need a random number?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_This is a demo app showing basic usage of the Bogue library._

Click on the 'randomize' button, and it will give you a random
number. Very handy if you don't have a dice in your pocket. Or a coin
to flip. Or if you want to predict the upcoming National Lottery.

Moreover, it will give you a much *better* random number than a simple
call to "rand" from your favorite library, because it depends on the
duration of the button press, which is very hard to reproduce. No
kidding.

Of course, you can customize the interval of numbers you expect. So
this is a truly *complete app*!
